# Credit

No good guide is made by one man, here's credit to those who've helped out:

* [DhinakG](https://github.com/dhinakg)
  * Cleaned up XFX GPU section

And From the original [Mojave GPU Buyers Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/b91vf5/mojave_gpu_buyers_guide/) that this was built off:

* [u/bankopf](https://www.reddit.com/u/bankopf/)
  * non X variants of the R9 series are not native and need to use a FakeID
* [u/midi1996](credit.md)
  * Highest Supported OS
  * Changed order of nVidia GPUs for native cards first
  * Adding intel HD graphics
* [trs96](https://www.tonymacx86.com/members/trs96.507278/)
  * Added NVS 510

And special thanks to [MacFriedIntel](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/profile/2126916-macfriedintel/) for stealing this guide, [rehosting it on his own site](https://boards.osx86.io/t/gpu-buyers-guide-june-2019/56), [blocking me from the insanelymac discord](https://imgur.com/a/DLBFhKS) and removing all credit from me. You are the people that make this hackintosh community what it is. But I guess there's one positive, who would steal a shitty guide?
