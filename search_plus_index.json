{"./":{"url":"./","title":"GPU Buyers Guide","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Thu Apr 16 2020 19:05:29 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) Introduction So it's that time of year again, a new version of macOS has been released and the age-old question will be asked once again: What GPUs are supported with macOS 10.15 Catalina? Well you've come to the right place, I'll give a quick rundown on the situation and go into more detail on exact GPUs we recommend. While this is named the Catalina GPU Buyers guide, this has info for High Sierra, Mojave and Catalina. And for those interested, you can find my old Mojave GPU Buyer's Guide here A quick refresher with Nvidia and WebDrivers Well currently as of the time of writing, we've gone a full OS cycle without official drivers from Nvidia for their Maxwell, Pascal or Turing GPUs. What this means is that users of these GPUs have no support for either Mojave or Catalina so are stuck with macOS 10.13 High Sierra. Who's to blame? Well it's 2 giant, egotistical companies who both refuse to work together so the blame can go both ways. Do keep in mind that the WebDrivers have a VRAM leakage issue that they've yet to address, so a theory to why Apple refuses Nvidia drivers in macOS may be due to how Nvidia refuses to hand over the driver stack. Think it's a coincidence that both AMD and intel have open-sourced drivers? Well, either way, it doesn't change the fact there's no support. Users with Kepler based GPUs are in the clear though, they utilize Apple's native drivers And for thoe who want some reading to do: When will the Nvidia Web Drivers be released for macOS Mojave 10.14 Great read as it shows how even upper management doesn't have a good answer for customers So if my GPU is natively supported, why do i need Lilu and WhateverGreen? This is a question comes up quite a bit in the Hackintosh community, and for good reason as to why in the world would these GPUs work out of the box on a mac and not a Hackintosh? Well, the reason being is that PCs and Macs have different internal wiring and so the ACPI layouts in a PC don't work well with Macs in different scenarios. To get around this, we use WhateverGreen and it's companion Lilu to patch different parts of our Hackintosh like renaming devices, assisting in framebuffer connections, patching audio connectors, allowing modifications to aty_config, aty_properties, cail_properties via ACPI and so much more. With such a large feature set and developed by someone who knows what they're doing, there's no reason not to use it So what are my options? So there’s still 2 routes for discrete GPUs you can go, either AMD or Nvidia(Yes, there’s actually natively supported Nvidia cards in Catalina). So I’ll be going over what GPUs are compatible and what features/drawbacks they hold. Things to remember: macOS does not support either SLI, Crossfire or GPUs will multiple main cores(like the Radeon Pro Duo). This may change with the release of the Radeon Pro Vega II Duo in the Mac Pro Getting audio through HDMI/DisplayPort may require extra work with both AppleALC.kext and some other IO-REG edits GPU Overclocking is limited to Vega 10 GPUs with PyVega Running a supported GPU with an unsupported GPU can have weird consequences as unsupported GPUs run off VESA drivers which have the issue in which it can break sleep and other functions in macOS. Please refer to the Disabling unsupported GPUs Guide for more info Can I run an unsupported GPU in my hack? So something to keep in mind when running an unsupported GPU in macOS is will fall back on VESA drivers when no real drivers are present. These are very simple, CPU based drivers that are used as a stop-gap while you wait to install the correct drivers but many baisc functions of macOS are broken when running this way including sleep and general stability. And since these GPUs have no drivers even outside of Apple, we need some way to stop the unsupported GPU from being recognized in macOS. So what do we do? Well I'm glad you ask. With my patent pending How to disable your unsupported GPU for macOS Guide, even a simpleton like you can experience the glories of Mojave and beyond! But can I render macOS on my iGPU but use the video outs on my unsupported GPU? Unfortunately not, and the reason being is actually quite similar to how Nvidia's Optimus technology functions. You would first need a way to grab/encode the iGPU's signal, send it towards the discrete GPU, then have said GPU decode the signal and display it. One small problem, decoding the signal would require proper GPU acceleration which your unsupported GPU doesn't have. So you will need to use your motherboard's video out ports no matter what "},"modern-gpus/amd-gpu.html":{"url":"modern-gpus/amd-gpu.html","title":"AMD GPUs","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Thu Apr 16 2020 19:05:29 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) AMD GPUs Native AMD GPUs Navi 10 Series (RX 5000) Highest Supported OS: Catalina Currently, as of 10.15.1, Apple has finally added RDNA and Navi support! Supported Cards: RX 5500 RX 5500 XT RX 5600 RX 5600 XT RX 5700 RX 5700 XT RX 5700 XT 50th Anniversary Edition Radeon Pro: Radeon Pro W5700 Note: Most Navi cards currently require the boot argument agdpmod=pikera to get proper display out, also keep in mind DisplayPort can be a hit or miss as WhateverGreen needs to be adapted. See here for more info: RX5700XT: No dual monitor with WEG Needed kexts: lilu.kext WhateverGreen.kext Vega 20 series Highest Supported OS: Current/Catalina So all Vega based GPUs are natively supported in macOS with Vega 20 GPUs starting in Mojave. While natively supported, it's recommended to still have WhateverGreen.kext installed as this helps with proper framebuffer connections and fixes other odd issues like proper ACPI mapping and such Supported Cards: Radeon VII Needed kexts: lilu.kext WhateverGreen.kext Vega 10 series Highest Supported OS: Current/Catalina Just like with Vega 20, Vega 10 GPUs are natively supported in macOS though these card's support starts in High Sierra. Similar to Vega 20, it's recommended to still have WhateverGreen.kext installed as this helps with proper framebuffer connections and fixes other odd issues like proper ACPI mapping and such. And for those who want to overclock/undervolt, check out PyVega The only brand of GPUs to avoid with Vega 10 are XFX. The reason being is VBIOS communication issues which can't be easily solved with a reference BIOS due to how Vega's powerplay table interacts between the OS and GPU. Supported Cards: Vega 64 Liquid Vega 64 Vega 56 Radeon Pro: Vega Frontier Edition Radeon Pro WX 9100 Radeon Pro WX 7100 Needed kexts: lilu.kext WhateverGreen.kext Radeon 400/500 series (Polaris) Highest Supported OS: Current/Catalina Regarding Polaris, basically every model of card is supported as long as it’s running either a Polaris or Baffin core(lower end cards like the RX550 run a Lexa core meaning no support in macOS). The only brand of GPU you should avoid with the Polaris series would be XFX, PowerColour, HIS and VisionTek as many users have had issues with these cards with viewing Clover and macOS booting but other users have found fixes/workarounds(though nothing consistent). This seems to be caused by having an odd VBIOS that doesn't communicate well with macOS and the only real solution is flashing another VBIOS which is not ideal for most users. Supported cards: 400 Series: RX 480 RX 470D RX 470 RX 460 500 Series: RX 590 RX 580X RX 580 RX 570X RX 570 RX 560X RX 560 Radeon Pro: WX 5100 WX 4100 E9550 Needed kexts: lilu.kext WhateverGreen.kext GCN 3 and older based Cards Regarding GCN 3 and older, cards from these generations theoretically will have support for Metal in Catalina but due to how fragmented some of the product stack became meant that some cards may not have support. Generally, HD 7XXX series of GPUs and up are metal compatible but I’ll only list GPUs that have been proven to work. Radeon R7/R9 Current/Catalina R7/R9 is also natively supported in Catalina without too much issue but we cannot guarantee the success of R5 and R7 cards due to not having many reports of success with them. Also, be wary that differing from the reference design of these cards have many more issues that require a lot of work to get them to run properly. Sapphire cards are your best bet Supported cards: R9 Fury X R9 Fury R9 Nano R9 390(FakeID needed) R9 290X/390X R9 290/390(FakeID needed) R9 280x/380x R9 280/380(FakeID needed) R9 270X/370X R7 270/370(FakeID needed) R7 265 R7 260x/360x R9 260/360(FakeID may be required depending on model) R9 255 R7 250X R7 250(FakeID needed) R7 240(FakeID needed) Needed kexts lilu.kext WhateverGreen.kext Extras: radpg=15: Required for HD 7730/7750/7770/R7 250/R7 250X GPU initiaization) -raddvi boot flag: Fixes DVI, required for 290X, 370, etc InjectAMD: While deprecated, some users require this for proper initialization, avoid unless absolutely necessary Applying a FakeID Guide Radeon HD 8000 Series(8xxx) Highest Supported OS: Catalina HD 8740 HD 8760 HD 8760 HD 8770 HD 8850 HD 8870 HD 8890 HD 8950 HD 8970 Radeon HD 7000 Series(7xxx) Highest Supported OS: Catalina Dual AMD FirePro D300 Dual AMD FirePro D500 Dual AMD FirePro D700 FirePro W7000 FirePro W9000 HD 7700 HD 7730 HD 7750 HD 7770 HD 7790 HD 7850 HD 7870 HD 7870 XT HD 7950 HD 7970 Needed kexts lilu.kext WhateverGreen.kext Extras: radpg=15: Required for HD 7730/7750/7770/R7 250/R7 250X GPU initiaization) InjectAMD: While deprecated, some users require this for proper initialization, avoid unless absolutely necessary Unsupported AMD GPUs Lexa Series (RX 500) Highest Supported OS: None While these GPUs may share the same family name as the Polaris GPUs, these cards are drastically different meaning no support in any version of macOS. Similar to Navi and unsupported Nvidia GPUs, you'll need to disable the Lexa GPU due to how the Vesa drivers that unsupported GPUs run off of break sleep and other functions in macOS. Please refer to the Disabling unsupported GPUs Guide Unsupported Cards: WX 3100 WX 2100 RX 550X RX 550 RX 540X RX 540 AMD APUs (ALL VARIENTS) Highest Supported OS: None The integrated GPU found on lower end AMD CPUs have unfortunatly never had official support with community support quite lacking. While possible to get a display out with some work, graphics acceleration is basically imposiible making these APUs more of a hazard to macOS.

Users have reported issues with the GTX 650Ti, 660, 660ti but this is caused by a driver issue on Apple’s end by not supporting the GK106 core(or quite poorly as the issue seems to be memory leakage which also affects real Macs). Another issue with this generation is lower end products marketed as first generation Kepler are actually using a Fermi core but have identical counterparts running Kepler cores as well(GF 116 vs GK 107 found in the GT 640).

This means that there's a high chance of disotrion and overall instabilty when running these GPUs which unfortuanty have no real solution as even installing web drivers has no affect.

Please refer to this post for more info on Framebuffer patching as it goes in depth on how to get your system running. We will also be excluding iGPUs present in Pentiums, Celerons and Atom CPUs as these generally have never been supported natively and require quite a bit of extra work to get them working(to be more specific, GT1 based iGPUs don't work, Apple only uses GT2 and up in their macs) DRM Issues: With Haswell and newer iGPUs, DRM is outright broken on them with macOS Catalina.

They're the most common GPUs to have instability issues and many users will outright not get any video out past the Clover bootscreen making a macOS install virtually impossible. XFX should also be avoided if you can, because people also have trouble with it, although most XFX cards will work with CSM/legacy mode turned off (XFX cards have an issue with VBIOS, but the UEFI VBIOS is fine.) (Though it is possible to get the XFX RX 460/560 working with a VBIOS flash, it's risky and not recommended). And while Sapphire may be the best brand for Polaris GPUs, Vega GPUs are quite a bit of a different story. While many have working systems with Sapphire Vega, a good chunk of users also experience instability and issues with macOS functioning correctly. Update: With the advent of macOS 10.14.5, support for Sapphire Vega has been greatly improved. But do note that these issues were quite serious so tread lightly as all the kinks may not have been truly resolved All 550s will not work except for the Sapphire Pulse 550 640 SP, as the other 550s are Lexa core, while the Sapphire Pulse 550 640 SP is Polaris.

Well honestly in the current situation the only cards we'd recommend would be from AMD that are either Polaris(Rx 4xx, 5xx) or newer as GCN 3 and older can loose support at any time and the same applies for Nvidia's Kepler. Here are the cards we recommend and do remember that reference cards are generally the safest solution Fanless GPUs(0 DB) Unfortunalty the variety for fanless GPUs are quite small, while there are many GPUs with fan-stop these aren't perfect solutions. Models with no fan at all are limited to either GT 1030s which are unsupported past High Sierra or the GT 710 which could loose support some time soon Fanless models: GT 710(basically every model is single slot, half height and many are fanless) Fan-Stop models(no fan spin under 50/60C generally): Navi Sapphire Nitro+ RX 5700 XT Sapphire Pulse RX 5700 XT Gigabyte Gaming OC RX 5700 XT Asus Strix RX 5700 XT MSI Gaming RX 5700 XT Vega Asus Strix Vega 56/64 Gigabyte RX Vega 56/64 Gaming Sapphire NITRO+ RX VEGA 56/64 Sapphire Pulse Vega 56 Polaris Asus Strix RX 580 ASUS Dual series RX 580 Sapphire Pulse RX 580 Sapphire Nitro RX 580 Gigabyte RX 580 Gaming Single Slot GPUs Polaris Sapphire Pulse RX 550 640SP(make sure it's Polaris or Baffin based, this is one of the first RX 550 models that run a baffin core instead of Lexa) Radeon pro Vega Radeon Pro WX 7100 Radeon Pro Polaris Radeon Pro WX 5100 Radeon Pro WX 4100 Nvidia GT 710(basically every model is single slot, half height and many are fanless) Quadro Quadro K4200 Quadro K2000D Quadro K2000 Quadro K600 Quadro K420 Quadro 410 Half-height GPUs Radeon Pro Polaris Radeon Pro WX 4100 Nvidia GT 710(basically every model is single slot, half height and many are fanless) Quadro Quadro K600 Quadro K420 Quadro 410 The Most Powerful GPUs While it may seem obvious that the most powerful GPU would be the Radeon VII, do keep in mind drivers aren't as mature as Vega 10's drivers.

Do note, most of these bootflags are from WhateverGreen so refer to their FAQ for a complete list of boot flags. And for a list of all shikigva boot arguments, see here and DRM bootflags can be found here: WhateverGreen's DRM chart AMD Boot Arguments shikigva=40 + shiki-id=Mac-7BA5B2D9E42DDD94 Swaps boardID with iMacPro1,1 Allows for Polaris, Vega and Navi GPUs to handle all types of rendering, useful for SMBIOS which expect an iGPU radpg=15 Fixes initilization for HD 7730/7750/7770/R7 250/R7 250X -raddvi Fixes DVI connector-type for 290X, 370, etc -radvesa Forces GPU into VESA mode(no GPU acceleration), useful for troubleshooting Apple's built in version of this flag is -amd_no_dgpu_accel agdpmod=vit9696 Disables board-id check, may be needed for when screen turns black after finishing booting agdpmod=pikera Renames board-id to board-ix effectively disabling boardID checks, this is based off of Pikera's work here This is also required for all Navi GPUs due to the difference in framework with the x6000 drivers Nvidia Boot Arguments nvda_drv=1 A boot flag that refuses to die, STOP USING IT. Used for enabling Nvidia's WebDrivers pre-macOS Sierra but no longer works as it was moved to an NVRAM variable instead. For Clover, use NvidiaWeb under System Parameters in your config.plist. For OpenCore, use NVRAM -> Add -> 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 -> nvda_drv: in your config.plist. The WebDrivers in Sierra and High Sierra also support another boot argument called nvda_drv_vrl=1, this will actually do the same thing as nvda_drv=1 did in previous versions nv_disable=1 Forces GPU into VESA mode(no GPU acceleration), useful for troubleshooting and when having issues installing Nvidia's WebDrivers. This is a macOS flag so WEG is not needed. shikigva=40 Swaps boardID with iMac14,2 Useful for SMBIOS that don't expect a Nvidia GPU shikigva=1 Needed when you're wanting to use your iGPU's display out along with the dGPU, allows the iGPU to handle hardware decoding even when not using a connector-less framebuffer shikigva=4 Needed to support hardware accelerated video decoding on systems that are newer than Haswell, may need to be used with shikigva=12 to patch the needed processes agdpmod=vit9696 Disables board-id check, may be needed for when screen turns black after finishing booting agdpmod=pikera Swaps board-id for board-ix, needed for disabling string comparison which is useful for non-iMac13,2/iMac14,2 SMBIOS Intel Boot Arguments -wegnoegpu disables all GPUs excluding the iGPU, most relavant for users with Nvidia wanting to run Mojave+ -igfxnohdmi Disables DisplayPort to HDMI Audio Conversion -cdfon Performs numerous patches required for enabing HDMI 2.0 support -igfxvesa Forces GPU into VESA mode(no GPU acceleration), useful for troubleshooting "},"misc/discrete-laptops.html":{"url":"misc/discrete-laptops.html","title":"Laptop dGPUs","keywords":"","body":" Last modified: Thu Apr 16 2020 19:05:29 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) Laptop dGPUs Understanding what discrete laptop GPUs work This is a little subsection to talk about how you can find out if your dGPU would work in macOS. What in the world is a MUX chip? So a MUX chip is a multiplexer which handles how the iGPU and dGPU are routed to the internal display, with the dGPU always being hooked up-to the external outputs like HDMI and DisplayPort. This is what real MacBooks have for their graphics switching. So where's the issue with normal laptops? Most laptops on the market don't have this chip, instead opting for a software based solution like Nvidia Optimus where it will actually make a virtual window and reroute the dGPUs signal into the iGPU. This creates a delay and uses up more battery as you're running 2 GPUs at the same time, so Apple's solution is the most ideal but unfortunately costs more and is more complex to engineer. And the other solution means that there would need to be a lot of driver support on macOS for Optimus Support(which there is none of). A bit more techincal info on the matter So how do I find out if my laptop has a MUX chips? This is the difficult part as most laptop vendors won't even mention it at all anywhere even if they have one, easiest way to tell is if the display outs are directly tied to the dGPU. Mainly Alienware and Razer include such chips but most manufacturers opt for the lower price software solution for both AMD and Nvidia GPUs.
