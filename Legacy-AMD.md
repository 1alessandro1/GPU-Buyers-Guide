So what's this section for? Well quite a fe users have been wondering what the highest supported OS would be for their GPU if Mojave wasn't supported. While this isn't a definitive list it'll be more as a jumping off point as it's easier to say what architecture is supported instead of what OS is supported



**Radeon HD 8000 Series Highest Supported OS: Mojave**

This one's a bit weird as Apple hasn't shipped a mac with an 8000 series GPU, they still have support for this GPU within the RadeonAMDx8000.kext though your millage may vary with them

**Radeon HD 7000 Series Highest Supported OS: Mojave**

Little more support than the HD 8000 series though not by much, Apple has shipped macs with these GPUs but support is also limited

**Radeon HD 6000 Series(6XXX) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**Radeon HD 5000 Series(5XXX) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**Radeon HD 4000 Series(4XXX) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**Radeon HD 3000 Series(3XXX) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**Radeon HD 2000 Series(2XXX) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**Radeon X1000 Series(1XXX) Highest Supported OS: El Capitan**
