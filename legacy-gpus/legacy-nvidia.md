# Legacy Nvidia

So what's this section for? Well a decent chunk of users have been wondering what the highest supported OS would be for their GPU if Mojave/Catalina isn't supported. While this isn't a definitive list it'll be more as a jumping off point as it's easier to say what architecture is supported instead of what OS is supported. The GPUs listed have **theoretical** support but keep in mind that they're not garunteed unless shipped in a [Mac Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/HT201805) with even that being flacky.  Also keep in mind that this list will likely change as I furthur deeper into old drivers to see what PCI IDs are even supported

**Fermi series (4xx, 5xx) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

Something to note with Fermi GPUs is while they may be supported in macOS High Sierra users have experienced issues with stabilty. If you're expericing instabilty as well you'll want to downgrade to Sierra

**Tesla series (1xx, 2xx, 3xx) Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

Similar to Fermi, these GPUs are supported by High Sierra but users have experinced issues with these GPUs. If you experince instability as well you can downgrade to High Sierra
