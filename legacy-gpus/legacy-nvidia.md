So what's this section for? Well quite a fe users have been wondering what the highest supported OS would be for their GPU if Mojave wasn't supported.

**GeForce 400 series Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**GeForce 300 series Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**

**GeForce 200 series Highest Supported OS: High Sierra**
