# Legacy AMD

So what's this section for? Well a decent chunk of users have been wondering what the highest supported OS would be for their GPU if Mojave wasn't supported. While this isn't a definitive list it'll be more as a jumping off point as it's easier to say what architecture is supported instead of what OS is supported. The GPUs listed have **theoretical** support but keep in mind that they're not garunteed unless shipped in a [Mac Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/HT201805). Also keep in mind that this list will likely change as I furthur deeper into old drivers to see what PCI IDs are even supported

Also to note: InjectATI may be required for these GPUs
